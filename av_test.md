If you are experiencing problems running Wabbajack such as the exe being deleted or no progress during the installation phase, try adding the folder where your Wabbajack executable is and the folder where you wish to install the modlist to exclusions in your antivirus of choice.

Note: If you're using Webroot or any other free 3rd party antivirus it's likely that adding the folders to exclusions will not be enough and you'll need to disable or uninstall your 3rd party AV as they can incorrectly mark usvfs_proxy_x86.exe, among other files, as a virus, a file needed for Mod Organizer 2 to work. We recommend doing so anyway in case it's a free one, as Windows Defender is likely much better at stopping threats than that is (according to data from av-test.org https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/).

If you still think a file is a virus, you can upload it to virustotal and get it scanned by multiple antiviruses. Here is a scan of the file mentioned above, of which 2 antiviruses report a false positive:
